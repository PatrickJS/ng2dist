When the directive's [selector] matches\n * elements in the DOM, the following steps occur:\n *\n * 1. For each directive, the [ElementInjector] attempts to resolve the directive's constructor arguments.\n * 2. Angular instantiates directives for each matched element using [ElementInjector] in a depth-first order,\n *    as declared in the HTML.\n *\n * ## Understanding How Injection Works\n *\n * There are three stages of injection resolution.\n * - *Pre-existing Injectors*:\n *   - The terminal [Injector] cannot resolve dependencies. It either throws an error or, if the dependency was\n *     specified as `@Optional`, returns `null`.\n *   - The primordial injector resolves browser singleton resources, such as: cookies, title, location, and others.\n * - *Component Injectors*: Each `@Component` has its own [Injector], and they follow the same parent-child hierarchy\n *     as the components in the DOM.\n * - *Element Injectors*: Each component has a Shadow DOM. Within the Shadow DOM each element has an [ElementInjector]\n *     which follow the same parent-child hierarchy as the DOM elements themselves.\n *\n * When a template is instantiated, it also must instantiate the corresponding directives in a depth-first order. The\n * current [ElementInjector] resolves the constructor dependencies for each directive.\n *\n * Angular then resolves dependencies as follows, according to the order in which they appear in the [View]:\n *\n * 1. Dependencies on the current element\n * 2. Dependencies on element injectors and their parents until it encounters a Shadow DOM boundary\n * 3. Dependencies on component injectors and their parents until it encounters the root component\n * 4. Dependencies on pre-existing injectors\n *\n *\n * The [ElementInjector] can inject other directives, element-specific special objects, or it can delegate to the parent\n * injector.\n *\n * To inject other directives, declare the constructor parameter as:\n * - `directive:DirectiveType`: a directive on the current element only\n * - `@Ancestor() directive:DirectiveType`: any directive that matches the type between the current element and the\n *    Shadow DOM root. Current element is not included in the resolution, therefor even if it could resolve it, it will\n *    be ignored.\n * - `@Parent() directive:DirectiveType`: any directive that matches the type on a direct parent element only.\n * - `@Children query:Query<DirectiveType>`: A live collection of direct child directives [TO BE IMPLEMENTED].\n * - `@Descendants query:Query<DirectiveType>`: A live collection of any child directives [TO BE IMPLEMENTED].\n *\n * To inject element-specific special objects, declare the constructor parameter as:\n * - `element: NgElement` to obtain a DOM element (DEPRECATED: replacement coming)\n * - `viewContainer: ViewContainer` to control child template instantiation, for [Viewport] directives only\n * - `bindingPropagation: BindingPropagation` to control change detection in a more granular way.\n *\n * ## Example\n *\n * The following example demonstrates how dependency injection resolves constructor arguments in practice.\n *\n *\n * Assume this HTML template:\n *\n * ```\n * <div dependency=\"1\">\n *   <div dependency=\"2\">\n *     <div dependency=\"3\" my-directive>\n *       <div dependency=\"4\">\n *         <div dependency=\"5\"></div>\n *       </div>\n *       <div dependency=\"6\"></div>\n *     </div>\n *   </div>\n * </div>\n * ```\n *\n * With the following `dependency` decorator and `SomeService` injectable class.\n *\n * ```\n * @Injectable()\n * class SomeService {\n * }\n *\n * @Decorator({\n *   selector: '[dependency]',\n *   properties: {\n *     'id':'dependency'\n *   }\n * })\n * class Dependency {\n *   id:string;\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * Let's step through the different ways in which `MyDirective` could be declared...\n *\n *\n * ### No injection\n *\n * Here the constructor is declared with no arguments, therefore nothing is injected into `MyDirective`.\n *\n * ```\n * @Decorator({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\n * class MyDirective {\n *   constructor() {\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * This directive would be instantiated with no dependencies.\n *\n *\n * ### Component-level injection\n *\n * Directives can inject any injectable instance from the closest component injector or any of its parents.\n *\n * Here, the constructor declares a parameter, `someService`, and injects the `SomeService` type from the parent\n * component's injector.\n *\n * ```\n * @Decorator({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\n * class MyDirective {\n *   constructor(someService: SomeService) {\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * This directive would be instantiated with a dependency on `SomeService`.\n *\n *\n * ### Injecting a directive from the current element\n *\n * Directives can inject other directives declared on the current element.\n *\n * ```\n * @Decorator({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\n * class MyDirective {\n *   constructor(dependency: Dependency) {\n *     expect(dependency.id).toEqual(3);\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n * This directive would be instantiated with `Dependency` declared at the same element, in this case `dependency=\"3\"`.\n *\n *\n * ### Injecting a directive from a direct parent element\n *\n * Directives can inject other directives declared on a direct parent element. By definition, a directive with a\n * `@Parent` annotation does not attempt to resolve dependencies for the current element, even if this would satisfy\n * the dependency.\n *\n * ```\n * @Decorator({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\n * class MyDirective {\n *   constructor(@Parent() dependency: Dependency) {\n *     expect(dependency.id).toEqual(2);\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n * This directive would be instantiated with `Dependency` declared at the parent element, in this case `dependency=\"2\"`.\n *\n *\n * ### Injecting a directive from any ancestor elements\n *\n * Directives can inject other directives declared on any ancestor element (in the current Shadow DOM), i.e. on the\n * parent element and its parents. By definition, a directive with an `@Ancestor` annotation does not attempt to\n * resolve dependencies for the current element, even if this would satisfy the dependency.\n *\n * ```\n * @Decorator({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\n * class MyDirective {\n *   constructor(@Ancestor() dependency: Dependency) {\n *     expect(dependency.id).toEqual(2);\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * Unlike the `@Parent` which only checks the parent, `@Ancestor` checks the parent, as well as its\n * parents recursively. If `dependency=\"2\"` didn't exist on the direct parent, this injection would have returned\n * `dependency=\"1\"`.\n *\n *\n * ### Injecting a live collection of direct child directives [PENDING IMPLEMENTATION]\n *\n * A directive can also query for other child directives. Since parent directives are instantiated before child\n * directives, a directive can't simply inject the list of child directives. Instead, the directive asynchronously\n * injects a [Query], which updates as children are added, removed, or moved by any [ViewPort] directive such as a\n * `for`, an `if`, or a `switch`.\n *\n * ```\n * @Decorator({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\n * class MyDirective {\n *   constructor(@Children() dependencies:Query<Maker>) {\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * This directive would be instantiated with a [Query] which contains `Dependency` 4 and 6. Here, `Dependency` 5 would\n * not be included, because it is not a direct child.\n *\n * ### Injecting a live collection of direct descendant directives [PENDING IMPLEMENTATION]\n *\n * Similar to `@Children` above, but also includes the children of the child elements.\n *\n * ```\n * @Decorator({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\n * class MyDirective {\n *   constructor(@Children() dependencies:Query<Maker>) {\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * This directive would be instantiated with a Query which would contain `Dependency` 4, 5 and 6.\n *\n * ### Optional injection\n *\n * The normal behavior of directives is to return an error when a specified dependency cannot be resolved. If you\n * would like to inject `null` on unresolved dependency instead, you can annotate that dependency with `@Optional()`.\n * This explicitly permits the author of a template to treat some of the surrounding directives as optional.\n *\n * ```\n * @Decorator({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\n * class MyDirective {\n *   constructor(@Optional() dependency:Dependency) {\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * This directive would be instantiated with a `Dependency` directive found on the current element. If none can be\n * found, the injector supplies `null` instead of throwing an error.\n *\n * @exportedAs angular2/annotations\n */\n@ABSTRACT()\nexport class Directive extends Injectable {\n  /**\n   * The CSS selector that triggers the instantiation of a directive.\n   *\n   * Angular only allows directives to trigger on CSS selectors that do not cross element boundaries.\n   *\n   * `selector` may be declared as one of the following:\n   *\n   * - `element-name`: select by element name.\n   * - `.class`: select by class name.\n   * - `[attribute]`: select by attribute name.\n   * - `[attribute=value]`: select by attribute name and value.\n   * - `:not(sub_selector)`: select only if the element does not match the `sub_selector`.\n   * - `selector1, selector2`: select if either `selector1` or `selector2` matches.\n   *\n   *\n   * ## Example\n   *\n   * Suppose we have a directive with an `input[type=text]` selector.\n   *\n   * And the following HTML:\n   *\n   * ```html\n   * <form>\n   *   <input type=\"text\">\n   *   <input type=\"radio\">\n   * <form>\n   * ```\n   *\n   * The directive would only be instantiated on the `<input type=\"text\">` element.\n   *\n   */\n  selector:string;\n\n  /**\n   * Enumerates the set of properties that accept data binding for a directive.\n   *\n   * The `properties` property defines a set of `directiveProperty` to `bindingProperty`\n   * key-value pairs:\n   *\n   * - `directiveProperty` specifies the component property where the value is written.\n   * - `bindingProperty` specifies the DOM property where the value is read from.\n   *\n   * You can include [Pipes] when specifying a `bindingProperty` to allow for data transformation and structural\n   * change detection of the value.

(See: [Pipe] and [keyValueDiff] documentation for more details.)\n   *\n   * ```\n   * @Decorator({\n   *   selector: '[class-set]',\n   *   properties: {\n   *     'classChanges': 'classSet | keyValDiff'\n   *   }\n   * })\n   * class ClassSet {\n   *   set classChanges(changes:KeyValueChanges) {\n   *     // This will get called every time the `class-set` expressions changes its structure.\n   *   }\n   * }\n   * ```\n   *\n   * The template that this directive is used in may also contain its own pipes. For example:\n   *\n   * ```html\n   * <div [class-set]=\"someExpression | somePipe\">\n   * ```\n   *\n   * In this case, the two pipes compose as if they were inlined: `someExpression | somePipe | keyValDiff`.\n   *\n   */\n  properties:any; //  StringMap\n\n  /**\n   * Specifies which DOM hostListeners a directive listens to.\n   *\n   * The `hostListeners` property defines a set of `event` to `method` key-value pairs:\n   *\n   * - `event1`: the DOM event that the directive listens to.\n   * - `statement`: the statement to execute when the event occurs.\n   *\n   * To listen to global events, a target must be added to the event name.\n   * The target can be `window`, `document` or `body`.\n   *\n   * When writing a directive event binding, you can also refer to the following local variables:\n   * - `$event`: Current event object which triggered the event.\n   * - `$target`: The source of the event.

Thus a\n * directive in a child view cannot inject the viewport directive that created it.\n *\n * Since viewport directives are common in Angular, and using the full `<template>` element syntax is wordy, Angular\n * also supports a shorthand notation: `<li *foo=\"bar\">` and `<li template=\"foo: bar\">` are equivalent.\n *\n * Thus,\n *\n * ```\n * <ul>\n *   <li *foo=\"bar\" title=\"text\"></li>\n * </ul>\n * ```\n *\n * Expands in use to:\n *\n * ```\n * <ul>\n *   <template [foo]=\"bar\">\n *     <li title=\"text\"></li>\n *   </template>\n * </ul>\n * ```\n *\n * Notice that although the shorthand places `*foo=\"bar\"` within the `<li>` element, the binding for the `Viewport`\n * controller is correctly instantiated on the `<template>` element rather than the `<li>` element.\n *\n *\n * ## Example\n *\n * Let's suppose we want to implement the `unless` behavior, to conditionally include a template.\n *\n * Here is a simple viewport directive that triggers on an `unless` selector:\n *\n * ```\n * @Viewport({\n *   selector: '[unless]',\n *   properties: {\n *     'condition': 'unless'\n *   }\n * })\n * export class Unless {\n *   viewContainer: ViewContainer;\n *   prevCondition: boolean;\n *\n *   constructor(viewContainer: ViewContainer) {\n *     this.viewContainer = viewContainer;\n *     this.prevCondition = null;\n *   }\n *\n *   set condition(newCondition) {\n *     if (newCondition && (isBlank(this.prevCondition) || !this.prevCondition)) {\n *       this.prevCondition = true;\n *       this.viewContainer.clear();\n *     } else if (!newCondition && (isBlank(this.prevCondition) || this.prevCondition)) {\n *       this.prevCondition = false;\n *       this.viewContainer.create();\n *     }\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * We can then use this `unless` selector in a template:\n * ```\n * <ul>\n *   <li *unless=\"expr\"></li>\n * </ul>\n * ```\n *\n * Once the viewport instantiates the child view, the shorthand notation for the template expands and the result is:\n *\n * ```\n * <ul>\n *   <template [unless]=\"exp\">\n *     <li></li>\n *   </template>\n *   <li></li>\n * </ul>\n * ```\n *\n * Note also that although the `<li></li>` template still exists inside the `<template></template>`, the instantiated\n * view occurs on the second `<li></li>` which is a sibling to the `<template>` element.\n *\n *\n * @exportedAs angular2/annotations\n */\nexport class Viewport extends Directive {\n  @CONST()\n  constructor({\n      selector,\n      properties,\n      hostListeners,\n      lifecycle\n    }:{\n      selector:string,\n      properties:any,\n      lifecycle:List\n    }={})\n  {\n    super({\n        selector: selector,\n        properties: properties,\n        hostListeners: hostListeners,\n        lifecycle: lifecycle\n    });\n  }\n}\n\n//TODO(misko): turn into LifecycleEvent class once we switch to TypeScript;\n\n/**\n * Notify a directive whenever a [View] that contains it is destroyed.\n *\n * ## Example\n *\n * ```\n * @Decorator({\n *   ...,\n *   lifecycle: [onDestroy]\n * })\n * class ClassSet {\n *   onDestroy() {\n *     // invoked to notify directive of the containing view destruction.\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n * @exportedAs angular2/annotations\n */\nexport const onDestroy = \"onDestroy\";\n\n\n/**\n * Notify a directive when any of its bindings have changed.\n *\n * This method is called right after the directive's bindings have been checked,\n * and before any of its children's bindings have been checked.\n *\n * It is invoked only if at least one of the directive's bindings has changed.\n *\n * ## Example:\n *\n * ```\n * @Decorator({\n *   selector: '[class-set]',\n *   properties: {\n *     'propA': 'propA'\n *     'propB': 'propB'\n *   },\n *   lifecycle: [onChange]\n * })\n * class ClassSet {\n *   propA;\n *   propB;\n *   onChange(changes:{[idx: string, PropertyUpdate]}) {\n *     // This will get called after any of the properties have been updated.\n *     if (changes['propA']) {\n *       // if propA was updated\n *     }\n *     if (changes['propA']) {\n *       // if propB was updated\n *     }\n *   }\n * }\n *  ```\n * @exportedAs angular2/annotations\n */\nexport const onChange = \"onChange\";\n\n/**\n * Notify a directive when the bindings of all its children have been changed.\n *\n * ## Example:\n *\n * ```\n * @Decorator({\n *   selector: '[class-set]',\n *   lifecycle: [onAllChangesDone]\n * })\n * class ClassSet {\n *\n *   onAllChangesDone() {\n *   }\n *\n * }\n *  ```\n * @exportedAs angular2/annotations\n */\nexport const onAllChangesDone = \"onAllChangesDone\";\n"]}
